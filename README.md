# Daniel Arthur Gallagher

I come from Scotland, I'm gay, and I live in
[Milan](https://share.here.com/l/45.46796,9.18178,Milano,%20Lombardia,%20Italia?z=11.5&t=normal)
in Italy.

## Work ðŸ’»

I'm a Staff Software Engineer at [Subito.it](https://www.subito.it/),
an online marketplace â€“
the biggest in Italy and a part of [Adevinta](https://www.adevinta.com/) â€“
in the frontend: strong not just on JS but HTML and CSS from a
career I started at 19 years old in 2014 as an apprentice.

Since joining the company, I've worked on rebuilding the
of the listing and detail pages, and rolling out a rebrand of the site;
enhancing performance both as a key focus and as part of business as usual,
developing various search features (including a radius search on a map) and
running A/B tests to improve specific pieces of the UI.

More recently I have worked in an enabling and coordinating role, working
with my colleages in the product teams to boost their delivery; harmonise,
evolve and maintain standards and resolve technical problems that have an
impact outside of just one team.

I have quite a bit of experience conducting technical interviews, starting
from experience at the BBC,
and I have been able to continue in Subito for a number of rounds of hiring.
I enjoy interviewing, and try both to make sure that we get the information
that we need about the
candidate and that the candidate has a positive experience.

## Studying

### Tech âš¡

I try to write better JS than the minimal level possibile with a focus on a 
maximal use of the language and its vocabulary and syntax to get more runtime
guarantees from the code.
I've also doubled-down on Next.js and on trying to get as much out of the framework as possible,
reducing custom implementations and aligning with what it offers.

### Italian ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹

I'm a student at the [Dante Alighieri Society](https://www.dante.global/) and am studying towards a C1 exam.
