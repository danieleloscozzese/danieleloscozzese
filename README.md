# Daniel Arthur Gallagher

I come from Scotland, I'm gay, and I live in
[Milan](https://share.here.com/l/45.46796,9.18178,Milano,%20Lombardia,%20Italia?z=11.5&t=normal)
in Italy.

## Work ðŸ’»

I'm a Staff Software Engineer at [Subito.it](https://www.subito.it/),
an online marketplaceâ€”the biggest in Italy and a part of
[Adevinta](https://www.adevinta.com/)â€”in the frontend: strong not just
on JS but HTML and CSS from a career I started over a decade ago as an apprentice
at 19 years old.

Since joining the company, I've worked on rebuilding the application
of the listing and detail pages, and rolling out a rebrand of the site;
enhancing web performance both as a tactical focus and as part of business as usual,
developing various search features (including a radius search on a map) and
running A/B tests to improve specific pieces of the UI.

Since 2023 I have taken on an enabling and coordinating role: working
with my colleages in the product teams to boost their delivery, harmonise,
evolve and maintain standards and resolve technical problems that have an
impact outside of just one team.

This has in part been a platform-team role, and in part a Staff role, and
led to my promotion in 2024 to Staff Frontend Engineer in the team of
Core Engineering.

I have quite a bit of experience conducting technical interviews, starting
from experience at the BBC,
and I have been able to refine it in Subito over a number of rounds of hiring.
I enjoy interviewing, and try both to make sure that we get the information
that we need about the
candidate and that the candidate has a positive experience.

## Studying

### Tech âš¡

I try to write JS that's more than mediocre with a focus on a 
maximal use of the language to get more runtime guarantees from the code.
I've also doubled-down on Next.js and on trying to get as much out of the framework as possible,
reducing custom implementations and aligning with what it offers.

I've recently refreshed the purely Node.js side and have obtained the
Node.js Services and Application developer certificates from the
[OpenJS Foundation](https://openjsf.org),
part of the
[Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org).

### Languages ðŸ’¬

#### Italian `it-IT`

I'm a fluent and daily speaker of Italian and am certified to [B2](https://www.coe.int/en/web/common-european-framework-reference-languages/level-descriptions).
